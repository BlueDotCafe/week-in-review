              <li>Like love, coding is a choice.</li>
              <li>Yup, love isn't just a feeling. It's a choice you make everyday.</li>
              <li>Both take practice. Sometimes the practice feels good.</li>
              <li>And sometimes it feels harder. But have faith in yourself!</li>
              <li>And just like love, the practice is something we can do alone.</li>
              <li>But you will find it is better when practiced with others.</li>
              <li class="bg-success">Keep practicing, your love of coding is growing everyday!</li>
